1/ Setup

2/ Basic steps

class Account:
    self.balance = 0

3/ Oh no, history won't work

class Account:
    initial_deposit = Operation(date=datetime.now(), amount=balance)
    self.operations = [initial_deposit]

... but we need to make sure history lines are sorted:

    @property
    def history(self):
        lines = []
        balance = 0
        # Remove this sort
        for operation in sorted(self.operations, key=lambda x: x.date):
            balance += operation.amount
            line = HistoryLine(
                amount=operation.amount, date=operation.date, balance=balance
            )
            lines.append(line)
        return History(lines)

Let's go full calisthenic!
